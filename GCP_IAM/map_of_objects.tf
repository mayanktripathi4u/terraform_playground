# # In Terraform, you can use maps of objects to define complex structures for your resources. Maps of objects are useful when you want to define a collection of objects, where each object is associated with a unique key. This is particularly useful for creating multiple instances of a resource with varying configurations.

# # Example of a Map of Objects in Terraform
# # Let's consider an example where you want to create multiple AWS EC2 instances with different configurations using a map of objects.

# # Define the Map of Objects in a Variable
# # First, define a variable that holds a map of objects. Each object in the map will contain parameters for creating an EC2 instance.

# variable "ec2_instances" {
#   description = "A map of EC2 instances with their configurations"
#   type = map(object({
#     ami           = string
#     instance_type = string
#     tags          = map(string)
#   }))
# }

# # Provide Values for the Variable
# # In your terraform.tfvars or any other variables file, you provide values for the variable. Each key in the map corresponds to a different instance configuration.
# # Refer "terraform.tfvars"

# # Use the Map of Objects in Your Terraform Configuration
# # You can iterate over the map of objects to create multiple resources. Here's how you can create EC2 instances using the provided map:

# provider "aws" {
#   region = "us-west-2"
# }

# resource "aws_instance" "example" {
#   for_each = var.ec2_instances

#   ami           = each.value.ami
#   instance_type = each.value.instance_type

#   tags = each.value.tags
# }
