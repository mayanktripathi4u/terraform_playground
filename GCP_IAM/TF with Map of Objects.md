To manage IAM role bindings in GCP using Terraform, you can define a map of objects to represent the various role bindings across different projects, groups, and service accounts. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Define the Map of Objects
First, you need to define a variable that will hold the map of role bindings. Each entry in the map will represent a role binding with a project, and associated group or service account, and a list of roles.

```bash
# variables.tf

variable "iam_role_bindings" {
  description = "A map of IAM role bindings for various projects"
  type = map(object({
    project        = string
    identity       = string
    roles          = list(string)
  }))
}
```

2. Provide Values for the Variable
Next, provide values for this variable in a terraform.tfvars file or directly in the main.tf for demonstration purposes. Each key in the map will define a different IAM role binding.
```bash
# terraform.tfvars

iam_role_bindings = {
  "binding1" = {
    project  = "project-1"
    identity = "group:dev-reader@abc.eid.net"
    roles    = [
      "roles/bigquery.jobs",
      "roles/bigquery.jobUser",
      "roles/bigquery.admin",
      "roles/functionrunner"
    ]
  },
  "binding2" = {
    project  = "project-1"
    identity = "serviceAccount:sa-lower@iam.googleserviceaccount.com"
    roles    = [
      "roles/iamsecurity.viewer",
      "roles/bigquery.editor",
      "roles/bigquery.admin",
      "roles/editor"
    ]
  },
  "binding3" = {
    project  = "project-1"
    identity = "group:dev-writer@abc.eid.net"
    roles    = [
      "roles/bigquery.editor",
      "roles/viewer"
    ]
  },
  "binding4" = {
    project  = "project-2"
    identity = "group:dev-writer@abc.eid.net"
    roles    = [
      "roles/bigquery.editor"
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Use the Variable in Your Terraform Configuration
Now, use the variable to create the google_project_iam_binding resources. You'll iterate over the map of IAM role bindings to create each binding.
```bash
# main.tf

provider "google" {
  # Configure the Google provider
  credentials = file("<YOUR-CREDENTIALS-FILE>.json")
  project     = "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>"
  region      = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_project_iam_binding" "role_bindings" {
  for_each = var.iam_role_bindings

  project = each.value.project
  role    = each.value.roles[0] # For simplicity, using the first role from the list

  members = [
    for role in each.value.roles : "${each.value.identity}"
  ]

  # To create bindings for all roles, you would need to iterate over roles if they are multiple
  # Note: google_project_iam_binding can only handle one role at a time.
  # You might need to create multiple resources or use `google_project_iam_member` for more complex cases.
}
```
# Handling Multiple Roles
The google_project_iam_binding resource in Terraform manages IAM bindings for a single role. To manage multiple roles, you would need to create a resource for each role, like this:
```bash
# main.tf (continued)

resource "google_project_iam_binding" "bindings" {
  for_each = {
    for binding in var.iam_role_bindings : "${binding.project}-${binding.identity}" => binding
  }

  project = each.value.project
  role    = each.key

  members = [
    each.value.identity
  ]

  count = length(each.value.roles)
}
```

In this case, the count parameter is used to handle multiple roles, but keep in mind that google_project_iam_binding only supports one role per resource, so this approach might need further customization based on the exact requirements.

# Summary
Define the Variable: Create a variable with a map of objects to represent IAM role bindings.
Provide Values: Define the role bindings in a terraform.tfvars file or directly within the Terraform configuration.
Create Resources: Use Terraform resources to apply these IAM bindings. For handling multiple roles, you may need to create multiple resources or use other techniques based on your exact needs.
This approach allows you to manage IAM bindings across different projects, groups, and service accounts in a structured and scalable way using Terraform.
