To test and validate the count expression used in Terraform before applying it to a resource, you can create a simple example with a null_resource. This approach allows you to see the result of the count expression without affecting your actual infrastructure.

Here's how you can create a test setup to validate the count expression:

1. Create a Terraform Configuration for Testing
Create a new Terraform configuration file (e.g., test_count.tf) with a null_resource that uses the count expression you want to test. This configuration will print the values and the count.
Refer Code

2. Initialize Terraform
Initialize Terraform to download the necessary provider plugins:
```
terraform init
```

3. Plan the Terraform Configuration
Run terraform plan to see what Terraform intends to do. This will show the count value and the projects that match the condition:
```
terraform plan
```
4. Apply the Configuration
Apply the configuration to execute the null_resource and see the output:
```
terraform apply
```
5. Review the Output
After applying, review the output to validate the result of the count expression:

The project_count output will show the IDs of the null_resource instances created, which corresponds to the count.
The projects_deployed output will display the list of projects that match the condition.

Example Output
```
Run the commands and check.
```

In this example:

null_resource.test_count instances are created based on the count.
The projects_deployed output shows which projects are included based on the condition.
